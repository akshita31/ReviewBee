This is a project that is aimed at creating interactive visualisation of pull requests.
It is still in development stage.

To run the visualisation

1. cd src/D3Visualisation
2. npm i #installthe dependencies
3. npm run compile #compile the sources and runs in watch mode
4. npm run serve #runs a local server to serve the files

## Next steps
1. We now have the setup working for javascript.
2. Now we need to take the code for creating  force graph using d3.js
3. Also, we need to create the data pipeline for creating the data in c# and being able to query it from javascript and render it
